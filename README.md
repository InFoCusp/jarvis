# jarvis

jarvis is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is
available, etc!

### Running jarvis

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You need to start the redis server locally, so first install and start the redis server,locally

You can start jarvis locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    jarvis>

Then you can interact with jarvis by typing `jarvis help`.

    jarvis> jarvis help
    jarvis animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    jarvis help - Displays all of the help commands that jarvis knows about.
    ...

### Scripting

An example script is included at `scripts/example.coffee`, so check it out to

For many common tasks, there's a good chance someone has already one to do just
